# Portfolio

As a developing coder it is important to have an updated portfolio site as well as one that reflects your skill set. This assignment was to expand on the orginal templated porfolio we made earlier and make it more representative of our current skill. In addition to styling updates, I also added portfolio pieces from a selection of homework and projects. 

Here is a link to the deployed site: https://courtneypaasch.github.io/portfolio/
